# AGENTS

## Project overview
- raveloxzemu is a C-based Z80 emulator with a debugger-style prompt.
- Source lives in `src/`, public headers in `include/`.

## Build and run
- Build:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build`
- Run: `./build/raveloxzemu`

## Change hygiene
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `Unreleased` for user-visible changes.
- `compile_commands.json` is generated by CMake; do not edit it by hand.

## Coding conventions
- Match the existing style: 2-space indentation, snake_case identifiers.
- Prefer fixed-width types (`uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, etc.) from `<stdint.h>`.
- Keep helpers in the relevant module (e.g., instructions in `instruction.*`).
